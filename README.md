# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: ruby 2.5.3

* System dependencies:

Everything can be found in the gemfile but notable additions to a base project are:
bootstrap-sass 3.4.1
authlogic 5.0.1
programr 0.0.2
jquery-rails 4.3.3

* Configuration

* Database creation:

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
